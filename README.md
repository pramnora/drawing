## Introduction

Originally, I was using Windows OS/Operating System;  
and, this came with the FREE MSPaint/Microsoft Paint program...;  
however, when I later on switched to using Linux Mint OS;  
then, I also had to find other programs to use to practice doing drawing;    
some of which can be downloaded such as: GIMP/  
and, some of which can be used online.
